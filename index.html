      <p>I enjoy learning new things, hiking, reading, watching movies, shopping, and finding adventures to go on with my kids.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Something that allows me to make a good living while still having time for my family.</p>

      <p>Coding is something that is fun for me.  I have done a little coding in my spare time before the bootcamp.
